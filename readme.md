# Cyberpunk Idle Game

This project is a browser-based idle role-playing game set in a neon-soaked future. You control a lone runner who trains skills, completes jobs and fights street punks. Progress happens automatically over time and you can continue later thanks to local storage save data.

## Running the game

Open `index.html` directly in your web browser. No server is required; the entire game runs client side. Simply double-click the file or drag it into a browser window.

## Saving and loading

Game progress is stored using your browser's Local Storage feature. Data is loaded automatically when the page is opened and saved whenever the tab is closed or refreshed. Make sure Local Storage is enabled in your browser to preserve your progress.

## Basic controls

- View your runner's stats at the top of the page.
- Skills train passively every second. They will also gain experience when used in combat.
- The "Fight" button pits you against a simple enemy; choose which skill to train from the drop down.
- Available quests appear in the side panel. Start them once you meet their skill requirements.

Have fun experimenting and expanding the game!
